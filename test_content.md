# Gaming Lullaby

[SFX: SNES startup chime layered over 808]
ðŸŽ® "Insert cartridgeâ€¦ press startâ€¦"

[Verse 1 â€“ Soft Trap Melody, 8-Bit Arpeggio in Background]

Close your eyes, we're back in time,
On a CRT with neon shine.
Blow the dust from your Game Boy dream,
Link's still searching for the Triforce beam.

Mom says bed, but I hit save,
In a Sonic loop I misbehave.
Echoes hum from Final Zone,
Mario still chasing home.

[Chorus â€“ Ethereal Chords, Lofi Tape Crackle]

ðŸ’¤ Goodnight to the pixels, goodnight to the fight,
Street Fighter echoes in the arcade light.
Dream of cheat codes and secret lands,
Where Mega Man drifts through glittering sands.

Goodnight, sweet glitch, and broken screen,
Your lullaby plays in a Sega dream.

[Verse 2 â€“ Slow Trap Beat, Ambient Echo FX]

Princess Peach, a distant call,
Chrono paused in a crystal hall.
Sub-Zero's tears freeze in sleep,
Kirby floats where the pixels weep.

Memory card, hold my heart,
Final Fantasy torn apart.
Yoshi cries in lullaby tones,
As Donkey drums on ancient bones.

[Bridge â€“ Glitched FX, Dub Reverb]

Underneath the moon of Hyrule,
We drift past the Konami rule.
Samus in her morph ball curled,
A bedtime hero in a SNES world.

[Chorus â€“ Repeated, Add Choral Harmony + 808 Drop]

ðŸ’¤ Goodnight to the pixels, goodnight to the fight,
Street Fighter echoes in the arcade light.
Dream of cheat codes and secret lands,
Where Mega Man drifts through glittering sands.

Goodnight, sweet glitch, and broken screen,
Your lullaby plays in a Sega dream.

[Outro â€“ Whisper FX and Soft Fade]

ðŸŽ® "Continue? â€¦ Press start in the morning."
